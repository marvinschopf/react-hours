# ðŸ“† react-hours

`react-hours` is an OpenStreetMap [`opening_hours`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:opening_hours) specification compatible editor with a calendar frontend.

## Installation

Using `yarn`:

```bash
yarn add react-hours
```

Using `npm`:

```bash
npm install react-hours
```

## Basic example

A very simple example that renders the editor:

```javascript
import Hours from "react-hours";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

ReactDOM.render(<Hours />, document.body);
```

An `onChange` callback can also be specified, which is called every time something was changed in the editor:

```javascript
import Hours from "react-hours";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

ReactDOM.render(
	<Hours
		onChange={(osmString) => {
			console.log(osmString);
		}}
	/>,
	document.body
);
```

In addition, a string in the `opening_hours` specification can also be passed through as an initial value:

```javascript
import Hours from "react-hours";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

ReactDOM.render(<Hours value="We 11:00-12:00" />, document.body);
```
